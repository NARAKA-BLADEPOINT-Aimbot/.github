## **Comparisons with Other Mods**

While wallhacks let you see enemies through terrain and speed hacks give you insane movement boosts, the **Aimbot** is in its own league when it comes to ranged combat dominance. Wallhacks help you spot threats, but an aimbot ensures you can take them down before they can even react. Compared to recoil scripts, which just stabilize your weapon, an aimbot actually aligns your shots, making it the go-to choice for those who want precision above all.
